# Deterministic-Finite-State-Machine-Simulator

Simplistic deterministic finite state machine (DFA) simulator. DFAs can be easily created by adding states and transitions in the main menthod in main.cpp. Additionally, man.cpp can be easily modified to accept a DFA in the form of a file; information necessary for states and transitions is obvious and parsable.
